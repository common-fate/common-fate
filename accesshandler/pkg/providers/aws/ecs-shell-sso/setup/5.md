# Setting up Python shell access

If you are using this Access Provider to access interactive Python Flask shells on your ECS tasks, set the **accessToken** field to 'true'.

If you aren't using interactive Python shells on your ECS tasks, leave the field empty and skip this step.

The following instructions detail how to install the [granted-flask](https://pypi.org/project/granted-flask/) library for audited Python shell access.

### Installing the Python library

Add `granted-flask` to your Docker container's Python dependencies. This will depend on what dependency management approach you use. We've given an example below for `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install granted-flask
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### Set the GRANTED_WEBHOOK_URL environment variable

A `GRANTED_WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable must be provided to the ECS task pointing to your Granted Approvals deployment URL.

To find your webhook URL open a terminal at the directory containing your `granted-deployment.yml` file. Then run:

```
gconfig output WebhookUrl
```

Update the task definition of the ECS container with the following environment variable:

```
GRANTED_WEBHOOK_URL=<Webhook URL from the gconfig output>
```
