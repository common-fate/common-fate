# Setting up SSO fields


First we'll be running a few commands with the `aws` CLI - entering their outputs into the fields on screen.

Locate your `InstanceArn` and `IdentityStoreId` via
```bash
> aws sso-admin list-instances
{
    "Instances": [
        {
            "InstanceArn": "arn:aws:sso:::instance/ssoins-1234567890",
            "IdentityStoreId": "d-1234567890"
        }
    ]
}
```

Then enter the region where your SSO region is deployed too.
