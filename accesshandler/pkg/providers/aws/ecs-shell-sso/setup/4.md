title: Create an ECS IAM role
configFields:
  - ecsRoleArn
---

This Access Provider requires permissions to read ECS properties.

The following instructions will help you to setup the required IAM Role with a trust relationship that allows only the Common Fate Access Handler to assume the role.

This role should be created in the _same account where your cluster is deployed_.

Copy the following YAML and save it as 'common-fate-access-handler-ecs-exec-ecs-role.yml'.

We recommend saving this alongside your deployment.yml file in source control.

```yaml
Resources:
  CommonFateAccessHandlerECSRole:
    Type: AWS::IAM::Role
    Properties:
      AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
        Statement:
          - Action: sts:AssumeRole
            Effect: Allow
            Principal:
              AWS: "{{ .AccessHandlerExecutionRoleARN }}"
        Version: "2012-10-17"
      Description: This role grants read access to ECS for the Common Fate Access Handler.
      Policies:
        - PolicyName: AccessHandlerECSPolicy
          PolicyDocument:
            Statement:
              - Action:
                  - ecs:ListTasks
                  - ecs:ListTaskDefinitionFamilies
                  - ecs:DescribeTasks
                  - ecs:DescribeClusters
                  - cloudtrail:LookupEvents
                Effect: Allow
                Resource: "*"
                Sid: ReadECS
            Version: "2012-10-17"
Outputs:
  RoleARN:
    Value:
      Fn::GetAtt:
        - CommonFateAccessHandlerECSRole
        - Arn
```

### Using the AWS CLI

If you have the AWS CLI installed and can deploy cloudformation you can run the following commands to deploy this stack.
Ensure you have credentials for the same account that Common Fate is deployed to and that AWS_REGION environment variable is set correctly, we recommend deploying this role to the same region as your Common Fate stack.

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file common-fate-access-handler-ecs-exec-ecs-role.yml --stack-name Common-Fate-Access-Handler-ECS-Exec-ECS-Role --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

Once the stack is deployed, you can retrieve the role ARN by running the following command.

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name Common-Fate-Access-Handler-ECS-Exec-ECS-Role --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[0].OutputValue"
```

### Using the AWS Console

Open the AWS Console to Cloudformation in the same account that your ECS cluster is running in and click **Create stack** then select **with new resources (standard)** from the menu.
