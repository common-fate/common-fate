title: Create an ECS IAM role
configFields:
  - ecsRoleArn
---

This Access Provider requires permissions to read ECS properties.

The following instructions will help you to setup the required IAM Role with a trust relationship that allows only the Granted Approvals Access Handler to assume the role.

This role should be created in the _same account where your cluster is deployed_.

Copy the following YAML and save it as 'granted-access-handler-ecs-role.yml'.

We recommend saving this alongside your granted-deployment.yml file in source control.

```yaml
Resources:
  GrantedAccessHandlerECSRole:
    Type: AWS::IAM::Role
    Properties:
      AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
        Statement:
          - Action: sts:AssumeRole
            Effect: Allow
            Principal:
              AWS: "{{ .AccessHandlerExecutionRoleARN }}"
        Version: "2012-10-17"
      Description: This role grants read access to ECS for the Granted Access Handler.
      Policies:
        - PolicyDocument:
            Statement:
              - Action:

                  - ecs:DescribeTasks
                  - ecs:DescribeClusters
                  - cloudtrail:LookupEvents

                Resource: "*"
                Sid: ReadECS
            Version: "2012-10-17"
