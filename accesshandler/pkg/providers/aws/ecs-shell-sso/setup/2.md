# Locating your ECS Cluster

Locate your chosen `ecsClusterARN` by running the following command:

```bash
> aws ecs list-clusters
{
    "clusterArns": [
        "arn:aws:ecs:ap-southeast-2:1234567890:cluster/MyFirstCluster",
        "arn:aws:ecs:ap-southeast-2:1234567890:cluster/MySecondCluster",
        "arn:aws:ecs:ap-southeast-2:1234567890:cluster/MyThirdCluster",
    ]
}
```

Copy in the ARN of the ECS cluster you want to set up the Access Provider for.

Enter the region where your cluster is deployed.
