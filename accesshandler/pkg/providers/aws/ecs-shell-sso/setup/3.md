title: Create an SSO IAM role
configFields:
  - ssoRoleArn
---

This Access Provider requires permissions to manage your SSO instance.

The following instructions will help you to setup the required IAM Role with a trust relationship that allows only the Granted Approvals Access Handler to assume the role.

This role should be created in the root account of your AWS organization. _This is the account where AWS SSO is configured and your AWS Organization is managed_.

Copy the following YAML and save it as 'granted-access-handler-ecs-exec-sso-role.yml'.

We recommend saving this alongside your granted-deployment.yml file in source control.

```yaml
Resources:
  GrantedAccessHandlerECSSSORole:
    Type: AWS::IAM::Role
    Properties:
      AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
        Statement:
          - Action: sts:AssumeRole
            Effect: Allow
            Principal:
              AWS: "{{ .AccessHandlerExecutionRoleARN }}"
        Version: "2012-10-17"
      Description: This role grants management access to AWS SSO for the Granted Access Handler.
      Policies:
        - PolicyDocument:
            Statement:
              - Action:
                  - sso:DescribeAccountAssignmentDeletionStatus
                  - sso:DescribeAccountAssignmentCreationStatus
                  - sso:DescribePermissionSet
                  - sso:ListPermissionSets
                  - sso:ListAccountAssignments
                  - identitystore:ListUsers
                Effect: Allow
                Resource: "*"
                Sid: ReadSSO
              - Action:
                  - sso:DeleteAccountAssignment
                  - sso:CreateAccountAssignment
                Effect: Allow
                Resource: "*"
                Sid: AssignSSO
            Version: "2012-10-17"
          PolicyName: AccessHandlerSSOPolicy
Outputs:
  RoleARN:
    Value:
      Fn::GetAtt:
        - GrantedAccessHandlerECSSSORole
        - Arn
```

### Using the AWS CLI

If you have the AWS CLI installed and can deploy cloudformation you can run the following commands to deploy this stack.
Ensure you have credentials for the same account that Granted Approvals is deployed to and that AWS_REGION environment variable is set correctly, we recommend deploying this role to the same region as your Granted Approvals stack.

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file granted-access-handler-ecs-exec-sso-role.yml --stack-name Granted-Access-Handler-ECS-Exec-SSO-Role --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

Once the stack is deployed, you can retrieve the role ARN by running the following command.

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name Granted-Access-Handler-ECS-Exec-SSO-Role --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[0].OutputValue"
```

### Using the AWS Console

Open the AWS Console to Cloudformation in the root account of your AWS organization and click **Create stack** then select **with new resources (standard)** from the menu.
