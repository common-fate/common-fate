title: Create an IAM role
configFields:
  - ssoRoleArn

The AWS SSO provider requires permissions to manage your SSO instance.

The following instructions will help you to setup the required IAM Role with a trust relationship that allows only the Granted Approvals Access Handler to assume the role.

This role should be created in your AWS management account. This is the account where AWS SSO is configured and your AWS Organization is managed.

Copy the following YAML and save it as 'granted-access-handler-sso-role.yml'.

We recommend saving this alongside your granted-deployment.yml file in source control.

```yaml
Resources:
  GrantedAccessHandlerSSORole:
    Type: AWS::IAM::Role
    Properties:
      AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
        Statement:
          - Action: sts:AssumeRole
            Effect: Allow
            Principal:
              AWS: "{{ .AccessHandlerExecutionRoleARN }}"
        Version: "2012-10-17"
      Description: This role grants management access to AWS SSO for the Granted Access Handler.
      Policies:
        - PolicyName: AccessHandlerSSOPolicy
          PolicyDocument:
            Version: "2012-10-17"
            Statement:
              - Sid: ReadSSO
                Action:
                  - sso:DescribeAccountAssignmentDeletionStatus
                  - sso:DescribeAccountAssignmentCreationStatus
                  - sso:ListPermissionSets
                  - sso:ListTagsForResource
                  - sso:ListAccountAssignments
                  - organizations:ListAccounts
                  - organizations:DescribeOrganization
                  - iam:GetSAMLProvider
                  - iam:GetRole
                  - iam:ListAttachedRolePolicies
                  - iam:ListRolePolicies
                  - identitystore:ListUsers
                Effect: Allow
                Resource: "*"
              - Sid: AssignSSO
                Action:
                  - iam:UpdateSAMLProvider
                  - sso:CreateAccountAssignment
                  - sso:DeleteAccountAssignment
                  - sso:DescribePermissionSet
                  - organizations:DescribeAccount
                Effect: Allow
                Resource: "*"
Outputs:
  RoleARN:
    Value:
      Fn::GetAtt:
        - GrantedAccessHandlerSSORole
        - Arn
```

### Restricting access to particular Permission Sets

The CloudFormation template above will give the Granted Access Handler access to all Permission Sets in your AWS SSO instance. If you wish to further restrict this, replace the `AssignSSO` policy statement in the CloudFormation YAML with the following:

```
- Sid: AssignSSO
  Action:
    - sso:CreateAccountAssignment
    - sso:DeleteAccountAssignment
    - sso:DescribePermissionSet
    - organizations:DescribeAccount
  Effect: Allow
  Resource:
    - arn:aws:sso:::account/*
    - <SSO_INSTANCE_ARN>
    - <PERMISSION_SET_ARN_1>
    - <PERMISSION_SET_ARN_2>
```

Where:

- `<SSO_INSTANCE_ARN>` is the ARN of your AWS SSO instance from Step 1.
- `<PERMISSION_SET_ARN_1>`, `<PERMISSION_SET_ARN_2>` and so forth are the ARN of the Permission Sets to give Granted Approvals access to.

You can further restrict Granted Approval's access to only provision permission sets in particular accounts. To do so, replace `arn:aws:sso:::account/*` with the ARNs of the specific account IDs you'd like Granted Approvals to access.
