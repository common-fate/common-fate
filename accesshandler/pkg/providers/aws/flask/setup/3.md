# Finalizing Your Deployment

You can now test the connection!

Afterwards you will be able to:
- Create a Flask access rule
- Create an access request for the Flask deployment
- Assume into the ECS cluster

To finalise the setup you will need to install [granted-flask](https://pypi.org/project/granted-flask/)
-  More on this here [docs.commonfate.io/granted-approvals/providers/flask](https://docs.commonfate.io/granted-approvals/providers/flask)

Once you have updated your Flask deployment with the correct webhook URL you can test your connection with the `test` command
Run the following to test your configuration is correctly setup:
```
aws ecs execute-command --cluster {CLUSTER_ARN} --task {TASK_ID} --container DefaultContainer --interactive --command 'flask test'
```
