# Locating your ECS Cluster

Before running anything you'll want to assume an aws session for the account that you are granting access too i.e. `assume aws-production`

We'll be running a few commands with the `aws` CLI - entering their outputs into the fields on screen.

Locate your chosen `ecsClusterARN` by running the following
```bash
> aws ecs list-clusters 
{
    "clusterArns": [
        "arn:aws:ecs:ap-southeast-2:{ACN}:cluster/{ID1}",
        "arn:aws:ecs:ap-southeast-2:{ACN}:cluster/{ID2}",
        "arn:aws:ecs:ap-southeast-2:{ACN}:cluster/{ID3}",
    ]
}
```

Locate your `InstanceArn` and `IdentityStoreId` via
```bash
> aws sso-admin list-instances
{
    "Instances": [
        {
            "InstanceArn": "arn:aws:sso:::instance/ssoins-825968feece9a0b6",
            "IdentityStoreId": "d-976708da7d"
        }
    ]
}
```
